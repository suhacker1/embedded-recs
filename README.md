+ Jason Turner is well-renowned for his C++ evangelism (his [C++ Best Practices](https://lefticus.gitbooks.io/cpp-best-practices/content/01-Preface.html) repository and [starter project](https://github.com/lefticus/cpp_starter_project) may be of particular interest). 
He was on [a podcast](https://embedded.fm/episodes/247) discussing the ins-and-outs of embedded programming; more resources are included inside of the show notes and on his website. 
+ This isnâ€™t directly related to mbed programming, but [Bare Metal CPP](https://arobenko.gitbooks.io/bare_metal_cpp/content/) and the [awesome-embedded-rust](https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust) repository can greatly improve your embedded development skills (I apologize for the Rust advertisement). 
+ [Memfault](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/) and [Embedded Artistry](https://embeddedartistry.com/) have a plethora of useful resources.
